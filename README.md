# Photocite

**Photocite** is a python script append an image with citation text. I use this in [my genealogy research](https://pedigreepipeline.com) where I don't want the citation to become separated from the photo itself if the photo is distributed or otherwise moved around.

It chains together a few different command-line tools to do this:

- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org) is a command-line swiss army knife for images, it's a great tool and very fast. It even has some built-in captioning capability. I spent a bunch of time unsuccessfully trying to get this to produce the type of captions I wanted, but I didn't have any luck. I particularly had problems with mixing regular and italic text and with positioning the captions how I wanted.
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) is a document preparation and typesetting system. With this I found I could get the consistency and formatting I wanted in the citations.
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) is a universal document converter. I use this for converting Markdown to LaTeX.
- PdfCrop comes with the LaTeX/TeX installation.

Installing and configuring the above tools is beyond the scope of this README.

The basic flow is as follows: 

1. Get the dimensions and DPI of the image
2. If the image is a JPEG, get the quality of the JPEG
3. Read in Markdown and use Pandoc and Latex to create a high resolution PDF of the citation
4. Crop the PDF down to just encompass the text and some padding
5. Convert the PDF to a PNG and resize it to be smaller than the original image
6. Use ImageMagick to append the PNG to the original image.

```
usage: photocite.py [-h] [-co] [-t TEMPLATE] [-o OUTPUT] [-c CITE]
                    [image] [citation_text]

Add citation text to an image, or generate a citation image only.

  -co, --citation-only  Only generate the citation file without appending to
                        the original image
  -t, --template TEMPLATE
                        Path to a custom LaTeX template for pandoc (optional)
  -o, --output OUTPUT   Custom output filename (optional)

By default, the citation will be appended to the original image.
The output will be saved as "<original_image> with citation<extension>".

Usage examples:
1. Standard mode: photocite.py image.jpg "Citation text"
   The first argument is the image file, followed by citation text

2. Citation-only mode: photocite.py --citation-only b.md

3. Citation-only with direct text: photocite.py --citation-only "Citation text"
